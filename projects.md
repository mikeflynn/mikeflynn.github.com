### Conversations Plus

![placeholder](/public/images/coolio.jpg "Medium example image")

Ever been jealous of news broadcasters who have the benefit of having a picture of whatever their talking displayed behind them? Well don't be! Just fire up Conversations Plus, add in a few of your favorite keywords to look for and start gabbing. Conversations Plus is a web app that monitors what you or anyone else in microphone range is saying and displays images (or sounds, or gifs!) on the screen.

### STLToday Paywall Buster

![placeholder](/public/images/stltoday.jpg "Medium example image")

The St. Louis Post Dispatch is my hometown newspaper (Go Cardinals!) and when they instituted a weak client-side paywall I took it as a challenge to knock it out so I can continue to read my Cardinal news. It took a 5 minutes.

### Punching Kitty

![placeholder](/public/images/punchingkitty.jpg "Medium example image")

From 2009 to 2013 I wrote [an award winning humor site](http://punchingkitty.com/about) about St. Louis news (where I lived at the time). Punching Kitty was a writing project for the city of St. Louis to have a little fun and try to get everyone to stop taking themselves so seriously...and hopefully highlight some critical issues along the way.

The complete archives are still online: [Punching Kitty.com](http://punchingkitty.com/)
