## StrangeLoop (9/16)

*EXPLORING CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACES WITH AMAZON ALEXA AND GO*

Conversational interfaces are exploding in both development and use in 2016. Amazon's Alexa service and their Echo are at the forefront of this exciting new interaction model but Microsoft, Facebook and others have launched conversational bots recently. Who knows, maybe even Apple and Google will let us develop on their dueling voice assistant platforms soon!

These new platforms are challenging for developers both because of the platform diversity but also because conversational user interaction is very different than interacting with a GUI. What are the differences between these platforms? What's the best way to get started? What kind of apps work well with conversational interfaces? What are some ways to make your app as human as possible?

I've created several Slack integrations, worked with the Facebook Messenger bots API, developed applications on the Amazon Alexa service over the past year, and in 2015 I released go-alexa, a collection of libraries that help to create Alexa apps quickly in Go. In this talk we will cover the landscape of conversational applications, the major players and their platform strengths, some of the best practices I've learned, and walk through the creation of a basic Alexa Skill in Go.

*TEACH ALEXA NEW SKILLS WITH GO*

Mike Flynn is the CTO of Studio71 and was previously a software architect at Answers.com, a start-up consultant, and writer. He currently dabbles in various Go projects, but also works with Clojure, ReactJS, and Node.js. When he's not making robots with his kids, he spends too much time thinking of ways to make his Echo in to JARVIS.
