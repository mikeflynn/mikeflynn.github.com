Against my better judgment, I'm starting this blog (aka "Yet Another Project"). I really don't have time for this. Work (Senior Architect at [Answers.com][]), Family (new baby coming in a few weeks), and the "other blog" (the St. Louis gossip-focused [Punching Kitty.com][]) already tie up a lot of my day, but I wanted to have a spot to discuss the things I can't on Punching Kitty, like personal topics, and of course, technology.

I hope to post a much as I can with things like interesting ideas, cool photos, new products I'm playing with, and new projects I or others are working on.
