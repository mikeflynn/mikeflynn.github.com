I'm fortunate that I get the chance to do some occasional (and not so occasional) traveling for work, mostly to Los Angeles. Recently I had the chance to stay at the Andaz Hotel in West Hollywood, which has a storied history in rock and roll, but now they just include these orange dog-like things in every hotel room. There's zero chance I notice somethign like that and not figure out something weird to do with it...so I took the dog and make a little Instagram story with it over the three nights I stayed at the Andaz.

Reaction on my Facebook (mostly family and closer friends) was mixed. Instagram didn't care that much as I don't have many followers, but Twitter (mostly people I don't know) seemed to enjoy it. Not sure if picture storytelling via Instagram is something I'll dabble in again, but it was a fun experiment even if I have to deal with people asking my why I didn't buy the dog to take home with me (it was $250 and a bit like this had a 3 day shelf-life).
