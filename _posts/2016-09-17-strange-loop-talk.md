Nothing hums like [the Strange Loop conference](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/) machine! I just spoke at the conference yesterday in St. Louis and already the video of my talk is up and has 150+ views on YouTube!

Thanks, Strange Loop! It was an honor to be included in this year's roster of speakers at such a great conference. Hopefully, I'll see you in 2017!
