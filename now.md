### What am I up to right now?

* I've been working on finishing 3D printed projects. I'm making an NES-style Raspberry Pi case and a large Lego man for my daughter.

* Thinking about learning Rust in 2016.

* Ugh. I should work out. Where did I put those shoes?

* I'm trying to create a lot more video content in 2016. I want to capture my life with my young kids right now, and I always want to understand what it's like to create regular online video content.
