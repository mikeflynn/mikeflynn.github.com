### Location

Los Angeles

### Professional Title

CTO @ Studio71

### What am I up to right now?

* I've been working on finishing 3D printed projects. I'm making an NES-style Raspberry Pi case and a large Lego man for my daughter.

* Ugh. I should work out. Where did I put those shoes?

* Information security is my new hobby. I've been updating my offensive skills to better understand defense.
